## 📊 Marketing Mix Sales Predictor

### 🔍 Overview

This project uses a **Linear Regression model** to analyze how different advertising channels — **TV, Radio, and Newspaper** — impact **product sales**. The goal is to provide insights into the effectiveness of media spend and to predict sales based on advertising budgets.

---

###  Objective

* Build a regression model using `TV`, `Radio`, and `Newspaper` spend as features.
* Understand which media channels contribute most to sales.
* Predict future sales based on advertising budget allocation.

---

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains the following columns:

| Column    | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| TV        | Advertising spend on TV        |
| Radio     | Advertising spend on Radio     |
| Newspaper | Advertising spend on Newspaper |
| Sales     | Units sold (target variable)   |

>  Source: Commonly used in regression demos and tutorials.

###  Technologies Used

* Python 
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* Scikit-learn (for modeling)
* Streamlit (optional for interactive UI)

---

###  Workflow

1. **Load and explore the dataset**
2. **Visualize relationships** using scatter plots and correlation matrix
3. **Preprocess data** (if needed)
4. **Train Linear Regression model**
5. **Evaluate model performance**
6. **Predict sales** for new advertising budgets

---

###  Model Performance

* **R² Score**: `0.8953` 

> 🎯 The model shows that **TV and Radio** have stronger correlations with Sales compared to **Newspaper**.

---

###  Key Insights

* Investing in **TV and Radio** tends to produce higher returns on sales.
* **Newspaper advertising** has a relatively weak impact on sales in this dataset.
